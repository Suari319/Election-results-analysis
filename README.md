There are three ipynb files in this repository
These files are analysis on Lok sabha and Andhra Pradesh State election and a webscrapping file. 
please open the Loksabha ipynb file to check the data analysis of the Lok sabha election
I used python BeautifulSoup library to scrape the data from the website
Due to time constraints, we were unable to complete the analysis of the Sikkim and Odisha Vidhan Sabha.
